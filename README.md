# Sum-or-Product-optimised-solution
You are given a number ‘N’ and a query ‘Q.’ If ‘Q’ is 1, then you have to return the sum of all integers from 1 to ‘N,’ else if ‘Q’ is equal to 2 then you have to return the product of all integers from 1 to ‘N.’ Since the product can be very large, return it modulo 10 ^ 9 + 7
